        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Banana bread is <strong>love</strong>, banana bread is <strong>life.</strong></p>

        <h3>Ingridients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>140g butter<em> softened, plus extra for the tin</em></li>
            <li>140g caster sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs <em>beaten</em></li>
            <li>2 very ripe bananas <em>mashed</em></li>
            <li>50g icing sugar</li>
            <li>handful dried banana chips <em>for decoration</em></li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter a 2lb loaf tin and line the base and sides with baking parchment.</li>
            <li>Cream 140g softened butter and 140g caster sugar until light and fluffy, then slowly add 2 beaten large eggs with a little of the 140g flour.</li>
            <li>Fold in the remaining flour, 1 tsp baking powder and 2 mashed bananas.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for about 50 mins, or until cooked through. Check the loaf at 5-min intervals from around 30-40 mins in the oven by testing it with a skewer (it should be able to be inserted and removed cleanly), as the time may vary depending on the shape of your loaf tin.</li>
            <li>Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then remove to a wire rack.</li>
            <li>Mix 50g icing sugar with 2-3 tsp water to make a runny icing.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the icing across the top of the cake and decorate with a handful of banana chips.</li>
        </ol>
