Basic recipe website

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. 

This exercise will allow you to practice how to check the status of your git repo, stage changes, commit changes with a proper commit message and push those changes to GitHub. Also, how to add headings, unordered and ordered lists, text formatting, images and links.
